Simply a module in Terraform is just another folder or collection of Terraform code
files.

And you reference the outputs of that code into other parts of your Terraform
project.

It basically groups together multiple resources that are used together in your
project.

The main purpose of the modules is to make code reusable elsewhere so that you
don't have to keep reinventing the wheel.

The directory which holds your main Terraform code is called the root module,
always.
